Thread Dump Analyzer.

Usage:

    tda [options] <regex|command> <thread-dump-file> [thread-dump-file, ...]

The utility works by default in a manner similar to grep, processing the thread dump file
sequentially, one thread dump at a time. It filters the thread stacks based on given regular
expression and displays the output, subject to options. More than one thread dump in a single
file are supported.

The utility supports alternate commands ("diff", etc.).
