
Usage:

    tda [options] <regex|command> <thread-dump-file> [thread-dump-file, ...]

    java -jar tdanalyzer.jar [options] <regex|command> <thread-dump-file> [thread-dump-file, ...]

The utility processes the thread dump file sequentially, one thread dump at a time, filtering the
thread stacks based on the given regexp and combination of options. More than one thread dump in a
single file are supported. The filtered thread dump or the scalar result are displayed at stdout.

The default command, and simplest possible usage is to filter and display at standard output only
the stack traces that match the given regular expression. For example:

    tda http- thread-dump-file.txt

will display at stdout only the stack traces that contain "http-".


Options:

    -v <regex> <thread-dump-file> - sequentially reads the thread dump file and outputs
            at stdout all thread dumps that DO NOT contain the regular expression.

    -c (count) counts the number of threads that match the regular expression, but does not
            display them. It displays the count at stdout instead. If only the file name is
            specified, the regular expression is assumed to be "match all", as in the following
            example:

                tda -c thread-dump-file.txt

    -s (split) extracts individual thread dumps from the log file and places them into separate
            files. The name of the files is built based on the counter and timestamp (if
            available).


    --<ExtensionClassName> (example --FSI, --FFM) where the class should be available in
            com/novaordis/universus/tdanalyzer/extensions



Regular Expression Syntax:

tda is designed to use the same regular expressions as grep.

    Spaces - enclosing the regular expression in double quotes preserves spaces. Example

            tda "on object monitor" thread-dump-file.txt



Other commands:

    diff <thread-dump-file-1> <thread-dump-file-2> shows the difference between the thread dumps.
