Events Java Thread Dump Parser.

Usage:

    td [options] <regex|command> <thread-dump-file> [thread-dump-file, ...]


td is a command-line utility that parses Java thread dump file and turns them into events that
can be further analyzed and correlated.

tda works by default in a manner similar to grep, processing the thread dump file sequentially,
one thread dump at a time.  Multiple thread dumps (i.e. the result of multiple invocations, at
different moments in time), may be present in the file, and tda distinguishes this situation,
by handling each thread dump individually. Once the stack trances are parsed, tda matches their
content against the given regular expression and displays the stack traces that match.

The utility supports alternate commands ("diff", "split", etc.).
